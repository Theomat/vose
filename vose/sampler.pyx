    This is a data structure that allows sampling random integers with replacement in O(1) time. It

    Parameters:
        weights: A memoryview of weights. The weights are not required to sum up to 1.
        copy: Whether or not to copy the provided weights. Setting this to `False` will save some
            time during the initialization phase, but will modify the provided weights.
        seed: An integer used for reproducibility.
